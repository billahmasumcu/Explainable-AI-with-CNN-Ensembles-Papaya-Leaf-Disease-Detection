# Explainable-AI-with-CNN-Ensembles-Papaya-Leaf-Disease-Detection
We have utilized a convolutional neural network (CNN) framework that distinguishes between six common papaya leaf diseasesâ€”bacterial blight, carica insect hole, curled yellow spot, pathogen symptoms, yellow necrotic spots, and healthy leaves. Feature extraction techniques.
